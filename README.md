# Dirichlet-Process-Demonstration
A demo of Dirichlet Distribution, Dirichlet Process and the Chinese Restaurant Process based Gaussian Mixture Model Clustering
A few excellent resources that I referred to were:
* [This](http://blog.echen.me/2012/03/20/infinite-mixture-models-with-nonparametric-bayes-and-the-dirichlet-process/) blogpost by Edwin Chen. To be very honest, his explanation is excellent. 
* Jordan-Boyd Graber, Associate Professor, University of Maryland's Lectures on DPGMM. The videos on YouTube that I found excellent are [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTW530-QVxo) and the accompanying slides [here](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~jbg/teaching/CSCI_5622/17a.pdf). His lectures on Gibbs Sampling were probably the best.
* An extremely well writeen CRP based GMM [here]().
